Migrate your marketplace from WCFM, WC Vendors and YITh to Dokan with one click. Secure data transfer within minutes.

## Description

Building a multi-vendor store from scratch is tough enough, but moving from an already built marketplace platform to another can be unimaginable. But when you are restricted to a platform that does not meet your growing feature requirements, it can be harmful for your business. Dokan Migrator allows you to seamlessly migrate from WCFM, WC Vendors, and YITH to the Dokan Multivendor Marketplace. Migrate without losing data about vendors, orders, or withdrawal records.

**EASY TO USE, SIMPLE TO FOLLOW**

Like the rest of Dokan settings and functions, the Dokan Migrator plugin is created to provide advanced options in easy solutions. Whether you are new to WordPress technicalities or an expert, experienced tech-savvy person, this migrator guarantees hassle free implementation. Just a single click allows you to start the process with a dashboard to review the existing data on your marketplace before allowing the plugin to bundle the data and move it to Dokan.


**MIGRATING TO AND USING DOKAN**

When you activate the Dokan Migrator plugin (ensure that Dokan Lite is active as well), a banner on the plugin will notify you to migrate with a clickable link. When you click, you will be redirected to a dashboard to review the existing data (of vendors, orders and withdrawals) that will be migrated upon your approval.

When the migration process is complete, you will be able to take advantage of the advanced features of Dokan Multivendor and do more with the data migrated. View all your vendor information in a neatly organized Dokan dashboard. Review all store activities with Dokan while having control over marketplace orders and extended withdrawal options such as auto-disbursement and reverse withdrawal for cash on delivery payments.
